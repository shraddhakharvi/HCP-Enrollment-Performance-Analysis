🧩 Project Overview

This case study analyzes Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) based on their prescribing behavior, enrollments, satisfaction (NPS), and retention trends. The goal is to identify top-performing specialties, engagement patterns, and differences between HCPs who started prescribing in 2021 vs 2022.

The project combines Excel analysis for calculations and Power BI for interactive reporting — enabling clear business decisions and insights.
